Machine Learning Intern Assessment Assignment
Assignment Title : Customer Churn Prediction
Assignment Description:
At Sunbase, we prioritize understanding our customers and ensuring their satisfaction. To achieve this, we want to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn. Your task as a Machine Learning Intern is to work on this project, following the guidelines and responsibilities outlined in the job description.
Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. You will follow a typical machine learning project pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment.
Data:
You are provided with a dataset containing historical customer information, including customer attributes, interactions, and whether they churned or not. The dataset is in CSV format.
Tasks:
1. Data Preprocessing:
 Load the provided dataset and perform initial data exploration.
 Handle missing data and outliers.
 Prepare the data for machine learning by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into training and testing sets.
2. Feature Engineering:
 Generate relevant features from the dataset that can help improve the model's prediction accuracy.
 Apply feature scaling or normalization if necessary.
3. Model Building:
 Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or neural networks).
 Train and validate the selected model on the training dataset.
 Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
4. Model Optimization:
 Fine-tune the model parameters to improve its predictive performance.
 Explore techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
5. Model Deployment:
 Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it into a production-like environment (you can simulate this in a development environment).
 Ensure the model can take new customer data as input and provide churn predictions
